# Covid: UK live music scene on 'red alert' amid pandemic

In October we took another look at the state of the live music industry in the UK amid the pandemic. 

Operators across the country said they would have to rely on fundraising activities to make it through the winter.

The 10pm curfew imposed on 24 September could leave the businesses having to trade on an eighth of their usual income, a charity leader told the BBC.

Close to £3m had been raised for a campaign to keep grassroots operators alive in the UK since April.

But the Music Venues Trust (MVT), running the campaign, said the mix of social distancing rules and the curfew would still leave its members facing a difficult winter.

## Data

We provided our partners with a spreadsheet containing the details of, and links to, all of the ongoing fundraising campaigns on the Crowdfunder website.

We also compiled a report with quotes from the Music Venues Trust, popstar KT Tunstall and operators of venues in Leicester and Stockton-on-Tees.
